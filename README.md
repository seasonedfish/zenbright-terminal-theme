# Zenbright Terminal Theme
I like the [Zenbones](https://github.com/mcchrish/zenbones.nvim) colorschemes' terminal colors,
but I prefer a bright white (#ffffff) background.

This theme is my small edit of `zenwritten`.
I've changed the background to bright white
and the selection color from light gray to light blue.
